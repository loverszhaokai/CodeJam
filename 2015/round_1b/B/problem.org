** Problem

You are a landlord who owns a building that is an  _R x C_  grid of apartments; 
each apartment is a unit square cell with  _four walls_ 

You want to rent out  _N_  of these apartments to tenants, 
with exactly one tenant per apartment, and leave the others empty. 

Unfortunately, all of your potential tenants are noisy, 
so whenever any two occupied apartments share a wall (and not just a corner), 
this will add  _one point of unhappiness_ to the building. 

For example, a  2x2  building in which every apartment is occupied has four walls 
that are shared by neighboring tenants, and so the building's unhappiness score is 4.

If you place your N tenants optimally,  _what is the minimum unhappiness value for your building_ ?


** Input

each contains three space-separated integers: R, C, and N.
